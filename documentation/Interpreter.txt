To start:
	Searches each line for the phrase "<TAB>once-upon-a-time" / "<TAB>this-is-where-the-program-starts" to be the entrypoint.

Tokens:
	Line:
		run hello from world
	Split:
		[run, hello, from, world]
	Make Token "run":
		TokenFactory.make("run")
	Resolve token:
		RunToken.resolve([hello, from, world])
	RunToken:
		RunToken now contains hello {hello}
		returns [from, world]
	Resolve next token...

Brackets are just to demonstrate:
run (hello) from (world)
run (hello) from (world) from (universe)
run (the result of (get_hello)) from (world) from (universe)
run (the result of (get_hello)) from (the result of (get_world)) from (universe)

Resolving RUN creates a RunToken with contents ResultOfToken(ReadParagraphToken(get_hello))
